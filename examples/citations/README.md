In this example, we uses the Go-IEEE API wrapper to find the references of a document given its id, print their title, and if it contains itself (which should not occur), it returns an error.

We'll look for a the document `5070278`, not related to this Golang API wrapper around the IEEE API, but has the particularity to contains itself it its references.
